So this is it. The end of the story of our hero.
The eagles flew our MC all the way to Paris - aka Sand People' Land
The city is in ruin. Up on that Eff Tower, Shrek has his blade ready to stab the hell out of our MC.
Others would have fallen, but not our MC. Going thru the heartbreaking of 1st love, the midlife crisis, Shrek is nothing but lil bitch.
As the evil Shrek flying down on the back of Dronky, our hero jumped up with his chainsaw thinking: "Our fight will be legendary!"
It's hard to tell who will prevail. On one hand, MC has the advantage of diversity, on the other hand is Shrek.
CLASH!!!

Truc as he kneeled before Shrek said, "Do me your worst, daddy, I'll take anything from you"
